    "For the final lesson in this guide, we'll learn about random forest models. As we saw last time, decision trees are a conceptually simple predictive modeling technique, but when you start building deep trees, they become complicated and likely to overfit your training data. In addition, decision trees are constructed in a way such that branch splits are always made on variables that appear to be the most significant first, even if those splits do not lead to optimal outcomes as the tree grows. Random forests are an extension of decision trees that address these shortcomings."

    "A random forest model is a collection of decision tree models that are combined together to make predictions. When you make a random forest, you have to specify the number of decision trees you want to use to make the model. The random forest algorithm then takes random samples of observations from your training data and builds a decision tree model for each sample. The random samples are typically drawn with replacement, meaning the same observation can be drawn multiple times. The end result is a bunch of decision trees that are created with different groups of data records drawn from the original training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The decision trees in a random forest model are a little different than the standard decision trees we made last time. Instead of growing trees where every single explanatory variable can potentially be used to make a branch at any level in the tree, random forests limit the variables that can be used to make a split in the decision tree to some random subset of the explanatory variables. Limiting the splits in this fashion helps avoid the pitfall of always splitting on the same variables and helps random forests create a wider variety of trees to reduce overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forests are an example of an ensemble model: a model composed of some combination of several different underlying models. Ensemble models often yields better results than single models because different models may detect different patterns in the data and combining models tends to dull the tendency that complex single models have to overfit the data."

Although Python is a beginner-friendly programming language, it was not built specifically for data analysis, so we relied heavily upon libraries to extend base Python's functionality when doing data analysis. As a series focused on practical tools and geared toward beginners, we didn't always take the time to dig deep into the details of the language or the statistical and predictive models we covered. My hope is that some of the lessons in this guide piqued your interest and equipped you with the tools you need to dig deeper on your own.\n",
